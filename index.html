<h2 class="des"> Description</h2>
<p>Capybaras are the world's largest rodents, resembling giant guinea pigs. 
  They are known for their semi-aquatic lifestyle, with adaptations like webbed feet and eyes/ears positioned high on their heads for underwater visibility. 
  Their coarse, shaggy hair is brown, pale, or dark brown, and they have blunt snouts and short legs.
  Like other rodents, capybaras have continuously growing front teeth that are used for grazing on plants.
  They can stay underwater for up to five minutes to avoid predators.
  They have a heavy, barrel-shaped body which sits on relatively squat legs, shorter in the front than the back. 
  Their brown fur is coarse and sparse enough to reveal the grey skin beneath it.
   Capybaras have partially webbed feet, which help to propel them through the water or swampy areas.

   <h2 class="ori">Origin</h2>
   <p>capybara, (genus Hydrochoerus), either of two species of large semiaquatic South American rodents.
     Capybaras inhabit forests and wetlands from Panama to Argentina. 
     The larger of the two species, the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), is the largest living rodent in the world, growing up to about 1.3 metres (4.3 feet) long and weighing up to 79 kg (174 pounds).
      The lesser capybara (H. isthmius) is smaller, growing to about 1 metre (about 3 feet) in length and weighing about 28 kg (62 pounds). Some classifications list capybaras as the only members of family Hydrochoeridae, whereas others place them within the subfamily Hydrochoerinae of the family Caviidae.
       Capybaras resemble the cavy and the guinea pig.</p>

    <h2 class="temp">Temperament</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to capybara temperament, these gentle creatures are some of the most friendly rodents! Known for their calm and laid-back demeanor, capybaras are incredibly social and typically get along well with humans. Their peaceful nature means they’re more likely to greet you with a curious sniff than anything else. Capybaras are often described as friendly animals that enjoy the company of others, making them beloved pets to many.

But it’s not just humans that capybaras are fond of—these social creatures are known to get along famously with other pets too. Whether it’s dogs, cats, or even smaller animals, capybaras often form strong bonds with a wide variety of species. Their non-aggressive personalities make them excellent companions in mixed-animal environments, where they often serve as the calming presence in the group.

However, like any animal, there are some potential risks to consider. While capybaras are generally docile, their large size and powerful teeth mean that interactions should always be supervised, especially with children or smaller pets. Understanding capybara behavior is key to ensuring safe and positive interactions. Overall, capybaras are more friend than foe, embodying the spirit of peace and friendliness in the animal kingdom.

    <h2 class="health">Health</h2>
    <p>
      Capybaras are generally healthy animals, but like any species, they can be susceptible to various health issues, including parasites, infectious diseases, and injuries. They are also known for their unique diet and social behavior, which can impact their overall health.
Common Health Issues:
Parasites:
Capybaras can be affected by a wide range of parasites, including protozoans and metazoans, some of which can be zoonotic (transmissible to humans), like Plagorchis muris and Neobalantidium coli, according to a study published in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) database [1, 2, 3, 5] (PMC8467752).
Infectious Diseases:
Capybaras are susceptible to various infectious diseases, including outbreaks of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (YPT), which can be fatal in captive populations, as reported in a study published in ScienceDirect [2] (S0147957122000686).
    </p>

    <h2 class="apprear">Apprearance around the world</h2>
    <p>
      Capybaras are found in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Northeast Argentina and Uruguay. They are semi-aquatic and will spend most of their time in dense vegetation around rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes and swamps. Feeding mostly in the afternoon, and on and off at night, capybaras tend to doze in the morning. They take short naps throughout the day while other members of their group stand guard.
